- [X] scanner projects

- [X] scanner separate ns priv and public vars with extension mechanism
- [X] indexer project facts
- [X] indexer file facts
- [X] indexer namespaces facts
- [X] indexer namespaces deps facts

- [X] indexer index parent fn in ref
- [X] create api ns
- [X] support extra schema to be merged on db creation
- [X] add some tests
- [X] add specs
- [ ] refactor file story
- [ ] scanner add ns :imports
- [ ] scanner deal with cljs clojure namespace aliases
- [ ] indexer process :imports aliases
- [ ] fix "clindex.indexer" ns file indexing
- [ ] add support for pom.xml
- [ ] improve the logs story
- [ ] redesign schema with isComponent so we can cascade retract a file > ns > [var var-ref] > ...
- [ ] re-indexing on file change
  - for file change watching we can use hawk
  - for file change and its dependencies tracking we can use tns.track and tns.dir
  - refactor scanner and indexer so we can get facts given a ns or file
  - need to figure out a way of retracting old facts, like if some forms were removed when changing the file we have to retract some facts in our db
    one thing that can be done is to keep a map in memory of facts by namespace, so once we reindex we can subsctract and figure out what facts need to be retracted
